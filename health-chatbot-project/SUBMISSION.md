## 🎥 Demo Video Script (2-5 minutes)

### Intro (0:00-0:15)
"Hi, I'm presenting **MindCare**, an AI-powered mental health support chatbot. Our mission is to make mental health support accessible 24/7 to anyone who needs it.

**Problem**: Millions struggle with mental health but lack immediate access to support.
**Solution**: MindCare - your personal mental health companion."

### Feature 1: Chatbot (0:15-0:45)
"Let me show you the chatbot. Notice the beautiful, modern interface designed to feel calm and supportive.

I'm going to type 'I'm feeling anxious today'.

*Type message and show response*

The chatbot recognizes the emotional keywords and provides empathetic, supportive responses. It can help with anxiety, sleep issues, relationships, and more.

Let me try another: 'Tell me about stress management'.

*Show response and explain NLP capabilities*"

### Feature 2: Mood Tracker (0:45-1:30)
"Next, the Mood Tracker. Users can log their mood daily with these emoji buttons.

*Click on a mood emoji, show the feedback*

Notice the mood history on the right. It tracks patterns over time and provides personalized recommendations. This helps users understand their emotional journey.

*Show the statistics view with mood counts*

This data is stored locally for privacy - nothing is sent to servers."

### Feature 3: Resources (1:30-2:00)
"The Resources tab contains curated mental health content. From anxiety management to sleep improvement tips, everything is evidence-based and professional.

*Scroll through the resources cards*

Each resource includes a description and can link to external professional materials."

### Feature 4: Emergency Support (2:00-2:30)
"This is the Emergency Support tab - one of the most important features.

*Show emergency contacts*

We've included crisis hotlines for 4 major regions: USA, UK, Canada, and Australia. Available 24/7.

Users in crisis can immediately find help. We also provide safety guidelines and intervention tips."

### Technical Excellence (2:30-2:45)
"Behind the scenes:
- React.js frontend with beautiful responsive design
- Node.js Express backend with RESTful APIs
- Intelligent chatbot using pattern matching NLP
- Local data storage for privacy
- Production-ready architecture

Everything is fully functional and can be deployed immediately."

### Call to Action (2:45-3:00)
"MindCare represents a complete solution to the mental health accessibility problem. It combines technology, design, and empathy.
